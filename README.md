# DiarySQL
Diary App Using SQL database with deletion enabled

###About/Usage
This app was designed to allow the user to never forget their cherished memories from each day. Entries can be added as often as 
desired and are saved onto the iPhone's central database using a SQLite schema. Entries can be revised and edited as desired, and
deleted by swiping on the entry's table cell. Add entries using the "+" button and edit them by selecting them once they are saved.
